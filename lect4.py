## Lecture 4 - Zybook 2.5, 2.8 â€“ 2.11, 2.19
# Big picture of using functions in code
# 1. Given the description of a problem in English, write the definition of a function that solves the problem

# 2. Given a monolithic block of code, use functions to make it more modular/readable: refactoring code

# 3. Given a complex problem (like the project), figure out how to decompose the problem 
# what functions you actually need to solve this larger problem

# Last lecture, we made the following claims about functions:
# 1.Functions make it easier to test code
# 2.Functions make it easier to find/fix program errors (bugs)
# 3.Functions make it easier to write code (come up with the right algorithm)

# Goal of today's lecture: 
# 1. Demonstrate the above claims by coding an example game: FizzBuzz
# 2. Demonstrate how to incrementally develop code/test code using functions
#
