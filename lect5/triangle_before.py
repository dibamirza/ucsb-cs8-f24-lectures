# Lecture 5
# Problem: "Triangle Type Checker"
# Problem Statement:
# Write a program that determines the type of a triangle (Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene)  based on the lengths of its sides. 
# The program should also check whether the three sides can actually 
# form a valid triangle using the Triangle Inequality Theorem (any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side).
