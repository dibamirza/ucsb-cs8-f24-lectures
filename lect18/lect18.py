# Practice problems with lists:


# Index vs. Value and accumulator pattern

# 1. Find the Index of a Target Value
# Write a function that returns the index of the first occurrence of a target value in a list. If the target is not found, return -1.
# Example:
# Input: nums = [10, 20, 30, 40], target = 30
# Output: 2

# def find_index(nums, target):
#      return -1


# 2. Sum of Values at Odd Indices
# Write a function to return the sum of all values at odd indices in a list.
# Example:
# Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# Output: 12 (5 + 7)

# def sum_odd_indices(nums):
# 
#     return 42

# 3. Is Value at Index Equal to the Index?
# Write a function to find all indices where the value is equal to the index.
# Example:
# Input: nums = [0, 2, 2, 4]
# Output: [0, 2]



# 4. Replace Even-Indexed Values with Their Squares
# Write a function that replaces the value at every even index in a list with its square.
# Example:
# Input: nums = [3, 5, 7, 9]
# Output: [9, 5, 49, 9]


# def square_even_indices(nums):
#
#     return 42


# 5. Print Index and Value
# Write a function to print each index and its corresponding value in a list.
# Example:
# Input: nums = [10, 20, 30]
# Output:

# Index 0: Value 10  
# Index 1: Value 20  
# Index 2: Value 30  


# def print_index_and_value(nums):
    # return


# 6. Find All Indices of a Target Value
# Write a function to return a list of all indices where a target value appears in a list.
# Example:
# Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4], target = 2
# Output: [1, 3]

# def find_all_indices(nums, target):
#
#     return []

# 7. Count Values Greater Than Their Indices
# Write a function to count how many values in the list are greater than their respective indices.
# Example:
# Input: nums = [3, 2, 5, 1]
# Output: 2 (3 > 0 and 5 > 2)

# def count_values_greater_than_index(nums):
#
#     return 42

# 8. Iterate Through Values Only
# Write a function to return the sum of all positive numbers in a list by iterating through the values directly.
# Example:
# Input: nums = [-3, 2, 7, -1]
# Output: 9 (2 + 7)


# def sum_positive_values(nums):
#     
#     return 42

# 9. Check if a list is a sublist of another list (Challenge problem)
# Assume both are lists of numbers
# Write the stub of the function
# Write two test cases
# Complete the function to pass the test cases
